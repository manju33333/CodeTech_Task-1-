Overview and Objective
This project aims to design and simulate basic digital logic circuits such as logic gates, adders, and multiplexers using Verilog. The goal is to understand the foundational principles of digital design and practice coding and simulation in VLSI tools.

Key Activities
Write Verilog code for:
Logic gates (AND, OR, NOT, XOR).
Adders (half adder and full adder).
Multiplexers (2x1 and 4x1).
Develop testbenches to test the functionality of each design.
Simulate the designs using VLSI software (e.g., ModelSim or Vivado).
Analyze the simulation results in the waveform viewer to ensure correctness.
Debug and optimize the code if simulation outputs donâ€™t match the expected results.

Technologies and Tools
Verilog: For writing digital designs.
VLSI Software: ModelSim, Vivado, or Cadence for simulation.
Waveform Viewer: To analyze input-output behavior.

Expected Outcomes
Fully functional digital circuits tested and verified through simulations.
Waveform analysis demonstrating correct circuit behavior.
Hands-on experience with Verilog programming and VLSI simulation tools.
